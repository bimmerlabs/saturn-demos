## HSL to RGB Demo
Based on an HSL color model I found in the [Sonic Mania decompilation](https://github.com/RSDKModding/Sonic-Mania-Decompilation), modified for the Saturn.  Change either a single palette index or multiple palette indexes simulaneously, to adjust Hue, Saturation, or Brightness of an entire background image or sprite.  [Use TGA Tools](https://github.com/bimmerlabs/TGA-Tools) to generate the necessary data structures for your project.
